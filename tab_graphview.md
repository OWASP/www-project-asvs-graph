## Data Relationship - Architecture

- ASVS Requirements under Architecuture have a deeper relationships that are simply waiting to be explored.
- Below is a minified JSON view of ASVS Requirements with the following (Apologies for renaming columns in ASVS Graph - Consistency will be brought in soon).
  1. `serial` represents column `item` from ASVS.
  2. `description`represents coulumn `Description` from ASVS.
  3. `stage` represents column `Name` from ASVS.
- With ASVS-Graph, we make this view to be more fruitful by tying a strong relationship based on any attribute deemed fit.
  1. Helping us derive a relationship that `Architecture requirements` flow downwards to other `verification stages`.
  2. Paint us a broader picture that there is deeper relationship between different `verification stages`.
  3. Convert **Hunches** to more tangible requirements.
